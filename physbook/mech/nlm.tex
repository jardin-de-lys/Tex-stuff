\chapter{Laws of Motion}

\begin{overview}
    Newton's laws lay out the foundation of mechanics, and present us with the laws of physics 
    that govern the everyday world. We'll later see that they aren't exact, but in the regime of common 
    every day tasks, they present us with the tools to analyse any mechanical phenomenon. We'll also go 
    through various applications of these laws along with the general discussion.
\end{overview}

\section{Introduction}

Classical mechanics is a deterministic theory, having known the state of the physical system at one instant,
it wishes to determine the evolution of system as time goes on. You may have heard of indeterminance in quantum 
mechanics through pop science, but remember that it doesn't invalidate classical mechanics. 

In general 
even a less correct theory is useful if we use it in the right regime. As long as we don't try to work 
in classical mechanics while our cars are moving at the speed of light or our balls are comparable to 
the size of atoms, we'll be fine.

Classical mechanics is almost entirely governed by Newton's laws. Using merely a few axioms, 
we can understand alot of the daily phenomenons that we see. Let's start with the first law. 

\section{The First Law}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item[\textbf{N1}] Left alone, a particle moves with constant velocity.
\end{enumerate}

There are various different ways to write it of course, in terms of zero net force and whatever, but to 
get the main physical insight from this we have to look a little deeper. First of all, what does it mean for 
a particle to be left alone? 

Well let's first take about things that are not left alone, for instance the planets. We know that each of 
them interact physically with the sun and rotate around it. And there are other examples, a ball being 
juggled, a cart being pushed, a nail being attracted by a magnet, etc. 

The common theme here is that each 
of the objects experiences a \emph{physical interaction} of some manner. Gravity, magnetic forces, 
the force we exert, all are results of a physical interaction between two bodies. 

And thus we expect that a body that if left alone does not experience any sort of physical interaction: it 
is \emph{isolated} from all other objects. 

This law doesn't really hold in all reference frames, but defines an inertial frame, which 
provide the setting in which newton's laws hold. We'll later see that a little modification of these laws 
will help us use them in any sort of frame, but we'll restrict ourself to inertial frames for now.

\begin{definition}
    An \vocab{Inertial Frame} is an observational frame of reference in which an isolated body moves 
    with constant velocity.
\end{definition}

The first laws then boils down to an axiom of existence, and that is the physical content of the law:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item[\textbf{N1}] Inertial frames exists.
\end{enumerate}

Thus the first law is part definition and part experimental fact. From experiments, we know that our 
axiom is in fact valid. But there is one issue here, can we always isolate a body? For instance suppose 
that the interaction between it and some object increased as distance increases: then we could never 
isolate it, no matter how far we went (going too close would give us all sort of other forces, like gravity). 

Fortunately, from what we know experimentally, this is not the case. All interactions eventually become
negligible as we increase the distance, so we can get an isolated body. Even without going to very large distances, 
we can manually cancel out the other forces to get such a body (for instance by using an air track).

In any case, the idea of an inertial frame is extremely important for classical mechanics, and we'll see 
it pop up quite a few times.

\section{The Second Law}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item[\textbf{N2}] The force on a body is proportial to the time rate of change of its momentum.
\end{enumerate}

Before talking about what forces are, let's define momentum:

\begin{definition}
    The \vocab{Linear Momentum} of a particle is:
    \begin{equation}
        \vec{p} \equiv m\vec{v}
    \end{equation}
\end{definition}

Thus it follows from the second law that the force, $\vec{F}$ is:

\begin{equation}
    \vec{F} = \dot{\vec{p}} = m\dot{\vec{v}} + \dot{m}\vec{v}.
\end{equation}

We choose our units so that the constant of proportionality is $1$.

For constant mass $\dot{m} = 0$ so that,

\begin{equation}
    \vec{F} = m\vec{a}.
\end{equation}

which is the form of the second law you are probably already acquainted with. There are a couple of problems 
here: what is $m$, and what do we really mean by a force?

First, let's talk about forces.

\subsection{Force}   

From the second law it almost seems tempting to include that whatever creates an acceleration is a force. 
There's some merit to that idea but then the second law just becomes a definition--- and how will something 
that we have purposefully defined as $\dot{\vec{p}}$ tell us something about the physical laws that we don't already know?

First of all if we go be the intuitive definition of force, which you may have heard of as a ``push or pull",
it is apparent that not all forces cause acceleration--- you can push a wall but it probably won't move (if it 
does, a strongman might be one of the career paths you want to look into). But really then how do we go about 
``defining'' what a force is?

The point of interest here is that force is not a mere definition, it \emph{exists independetly of acceleration}.
Whenever two bodies with some masses interact with each other gravitationally the force there is the gravitational 
force and characterises the particular interaction. The forces are specified by the model in which we are working.

Applying the same forces on two bodies should have the same 
effect as described in the second law. If $\dd{m}_{i,j}/\dd{t} = 0$, then:
\[
m_i\vec{a}_i = m_j\vec{a}_j.
\]
This \emph{can} be verified, that the ratio in which accelerations of the two bodies, that are produced by the same force is constant 
because $m_{i,j}$ do not change. 

There is also the question on how we find the forces which act in our model--- say what is the force between 
two stationary charged particles? The answer to that is well, using newton's second law. Acceleration is measurable,
and we know $m$ for a specific particle (we will talk about that in a second) so by varying different parameters,
the distance between particles, the masses of each, the charge etc. we can measure their acceleration, and thus 
we can find how force scales with these factors. 

This seems to almost invalidate our previous discussion--- we are know measuring forces through acceleration when 
we just asserted that they're independent of it. That's not quite true, however, it is only because we know 
forces are independent of the particle or acceleration at hand that we can say the same sort of force acts even when 
the parameters are changed and how that force scales with these quantities. 
After we have found the force, we can 
again say because it is independent of the acceleration, it acts on any body under the same model and use the results 
we have found.

If you haven't been able to follow the discussion completely, don't worry, this doesn't affect our practical usage 
of the second law. We will also make do with forces later, turning our attention to energy instead but that is a discussion 
for another time.

Another way to look at it is while the second law alone does not define a force, the three laws 
can be understood as an axiom system for defining what a force is. We don't really need an explicit definition in 
that case, many axiom systems are similar. If you are wondering why that is fine you might wish to learn logic.

In any case, using the three laws as axioms, all our preceding discussion tells us is how to experimentally verify
the second law, and how physical models independetly carry the information about what the force we are looking for is 
(rather than what forces in general are).

\subsection{Mass}

We will give an operational definition of mass.

this is going to take some time.


\section{The Third Law}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item[\textbf{N3}] The force on a body \(B\) due to another body \(A\) is equal and opposite to the force experienced
    by \(A\) due to \(B\). 
\end{enumerate}
